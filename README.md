# Quality Control, positive control fMRI task

This repository contains a Psychopy3 experiment describing the quality control fMRI task of the Human Connectome Phantom (HCPh) project.
The task contains a visual trial block, an eye-movement trial block, and a finger-tapping trial block.

The task has been derived from «Version A» of the task proposed by Harvey et al.:

     Harvey J, Demetriou L, McGonigle J, Wall MB. 2018. A short, robust brain activation
     control task optimised for pharmacological fMRI studies. PeerJ 6:e5540
     doi:https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5540

The most prominent changes to the original task are:

- Elimination of the auditive block (since we do not plan the parcipant to wear headphones)
- Substitution of the motor task (button pressing) with a simple finger-tapping paradigm
- Enabling eye-tracking with our SR instruments device.
